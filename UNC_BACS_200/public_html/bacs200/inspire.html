        <p>I wouldnt necessarily describe Ashton Kutcher as "My Hero". However I do appreciate his contributions to society. Aside from his amazing acting career(ie. that 70's show) Ashton Kutcher also runs a company that creates code to help catch human traffickers.</p>
        <p>I am aware there are many celebraties that do things for society however this(Ashton's work) has a larger impact behind the scenes to me.</p>
